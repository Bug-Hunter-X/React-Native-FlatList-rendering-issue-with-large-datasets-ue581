# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets. The problem arises when the component fails to correctly update its rendering after data changes, leading to incorrect item display or missing items.

## Problem Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a basic `FlatList` implementation that fetches a large array of data (1000 items). Under certain circumstances, specifically with large datasets and less efficient data update mechanisms or key handling, the `FlatList` component might not render the data properly, skipping items or displaying outdated information.

## Solution

The solution, implemented in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the issue by introducing a more efficient data update approach.  This can involve techniques like using the `data` prop's immutability to force re-renders or other optimization strategies for large data sets.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe the `FlatList`'s behavior. You might notice some missing or misplaced items.

## How to fix the issue

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a potential solution involving optimized data updates.
